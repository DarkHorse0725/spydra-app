v2.0.0-alpha April 5th, 2019
-----------------------------

Release Notes
-------------
The main change in the v2.0.0 alpha over v1.4.1 is the level of NodeJS runtime has moved up to version 10
v2.0.0 has v1.4.1 level of base functionality

Migration Notes
---------------
Note that a change needed to be made to the metadata schema as it was in error; it had diverged from the JSONSchema standard
so that it was not possible to validate complex objects.

If you have custom metadata defined in the contract, then for the complex objects defined in the 'components' section
the properties of this object where previously held as array; they now need to be held as a map with the key as the name
of the property

Return types on functions where returned as an array of schema objects. this has been modified to be a single object. i.e. 
the single value array is now just a single value.

There is also a new nodeenv docker image that is used for hosting the chaincode rather than use the baseos image.
